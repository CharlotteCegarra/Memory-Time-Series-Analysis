# Early Warning Signals for Financial Crises

## 📌 Description
The stability of complex systems, whether economic, financial, or meteorological, relies on a delicate balance. This equilibrium can be disrupted by unforeseen events or sudden changes, leading to critical transitions. 

This project explores the application of the **Critical Slowing Down (CSD) theory** to financial data to predict crises, such as the **2007 financial crisis**. Additionally, we analyze **Bitcoin prices** and **meteorological data** to extend our understanding of critical transitions in different domains, including economic, technological, and environmental systems.

By applying CSD indicators, we investigate whether early warning signals can help predict crises and systemic risks, evaluating variations in volatility, correlations, and statistical distributions of financial data before major disruptions.
